Contrary to the claims of a recent publication,

which proposes that arrays of tandemly repeated CA containing either methylated or hydroxymethylated cytosine are the primary targets for MeCP2 binding and function. We investigated these predictions using a range of published data sets and found **no support for the hypothesis that CA repeats are key mediators of MeCP2 function**.

Before starting the analysis, fulfill the [installation requirements](prerequisities.md). They should install the required software necessary for reproducing the analysis.
